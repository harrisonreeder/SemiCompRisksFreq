  abstract = {Semi-competing risks refer to the time-to-event analysis setting, where the occurrence of a non-terminal event is subject to whether a terminal event has occurred, but not vice versa. Semi-competing risks arise in a broad range of clinical contexts, including studies of preeclampsia, a condition that may arise during pregnancy and for which delivery is a terminal event. Models that acknowledge semi-competing risks enable investigation of relationships between covariates and the joint timing of the outcomes, but methods for model selection and prediction of semi-competing risks in high dimensions are lacking. Moreover, in such settings researchers commonly analyze only a single or composite outcome, losing valuable information and limiting clinical utility---in the obstetric setting, this means ignoring valuable insight into timing of delivery after preeclampsia has onset. To address this gap, we propose a novel penalized estimation framework for frailty-based illness--death multi-state modeling of semi-competing risks. Our approach combines non-convex and structured fusion penalization, inducing global sparsity as well as parsimony across submodels. We perform estimation and model selection via a pathwise routine for non-convex optimization, and prove statistical error rate results in this setting. We present a simulation study investigating estimation error and model selection performance, and a comprehensive application of the method to joint risk modeling of preeclampsia and timing of delivery using pregnancy data from an electronic health record.},

  abstract = {BACKGROUND: Preeclampsia is a pregnancy complication that contributes substantially to perinatal morbidity and mortality worldwide. Existing approaches to modeling and prediction of preeclampsia typically focus either on predicting preeclampsia risk alone, or on the timing of delivery following a diagnosis of preeclampsia. As such, they are misaligned with typical healthcare interactions during which the 2 events are generally considered simultaneously. OBJECTIVE: This study aimed to describe the ``semicompeting risks'' framework as an innovative approach for jointly modeling the risk and timing of preeclampsia and the timing of delivery simultaneously. Through this approach, one can obtain, at any point during the pregnancy, clinically relevant summaries of an individual's predicted outcome trajectories in 4 risk categories: not developing preeclampsia and not having delivered, not developing preeclampsia but having delivered because of other causes, developing preeclampsia but not having delivered, and developing preeclampsia and having delivered. STUDY DESIGN: To illustrate the semicompeting risks methodology, we presented an example analysis of a pregnancy cohort from the electronic health record of an urban, academic medical center in Boston, Massachusetts (n{$\frac{1}{4}$}9161 pregnancies). We fit an illnessedeath model with proportional-hazards regression specifications describing 3 hazards for timings of preeclampsia, delivery in the absence of preeclampsia, and delivery following preeclampsia diagnosis. RESULTS: The results indicated nuanced relationships between a variety of risk factors and the timings of preeclampsia diagnosis and delivery, including maternal age, race/ethnicity, parity, body mass index, diabetes mellitus, chronic hypertension, cigarette use, and proteinuria at 20 weeks' gestation. Sample predictions for a diverse set of individuals highlighted differences in projected outcome trajectories with regard to preeclampsia risk and timing, and timing of delivery either before or after preeclampsia diagnosis. CONCLUSION: The semicompeting risks framework enables characterization of the joint risk and timing of preeclampsia and delivery, providing enhanced, meaningful information regarding clinical decisionmaking throughout the pregnancy.}
